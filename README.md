# Cinder
Interpreted or Compiled, stack-based, RPN programming language.

## Defining Features:
  * Interpreted or Compiled  
  * Stack Based  
  * Uses Reverse Polish Notation for math functions  
  * Lightweight  
  * Useless  
  * Optimized for job security- very difficult to read.  
  * Has verbose debugging  

## Project Goals:
  * Create a VM implemented in Javascript that has its own bytecode.  
  * Create a compiler capable of translating Javascript to Cinder bytecode.  

Thus I will have a Javascript interpreter written in Javascript.
